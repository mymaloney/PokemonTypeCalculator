Requirements:
Python

If you do not have python, you can install it on Windows by opening the command line and entering the following lines

	curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
	python get-pip.py
	pip python

Once python has finished installing, navigate to the folder where you unzipped the contents of this file with

	cd (filepath)

and then enter

	python input.py

From there, you'll be asked to input your type chart. Make sure to use only lowercase letters and divide multiple types by a comma and a space. For instance,

	fire, water, grass, normal,

Once you're done with inputting your chart, you can run the calculator by running the following line in command line.

	python typecalc.py
	
Alternatively, you may run the program without first inputting your own type chart. If you do, the default gen 9 type chart will be used instead.

Feel free to share or edit these programs as you see fit.
